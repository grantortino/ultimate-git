# THE LIPSTICK GAME

Some girls just got it all wrong
At the show just to go home with a guy
They're still calling you the rock-star lie
It's okay, go with the public demand
Free admission
Let's take a ride in your van
You just wanted a good time
For once to be in the line light
But odds are
One night is less than you've bargained for
Let's play the lipstick game tonight
One time could drive me wild baby
Ooh yah
What kind of girl do you think you are?
Don't call you groupie that's going to far
One name
One name that would suit you
You check out the next group that comes to town
Before you know it your names spread all around
Shame how
Fame
Catches up with you
Let's play the lipstick game tonight
One time could drive me wild
Push
Let's play the lipstick game tonight
One time could drive me wild baby
